# wordle clone

welcome to **wordle clone**, a fun take on the classic word-guessing game built with swift. this app uses the [datamuse api](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) to fetch random five-letter words, keeping every game fresh and unpredictable. 🎉

---

## 🎮 how to play
- you get **6 chances** to guess the correct 5-letter word.
- after each guess, the grid updates with colors to show:
  - **green**: letter is correct and in the right spot.
  - **yellow**: letter is in the word, but the wrong spot.
  - **gray**: letter is not in the word.
- either guess the word or run out of attempts—your call. 😅

---

## ✨ features
- **datamuse-powered words**: every game is unique, thanks to a dynamic word database.
- **easy-to-use keyboard**: input guesses with a responsive on-screen keyboard that updates dynamically.
- **color-coded feedback**: enjoy satisfying visuals that guide your guesses.
- **win or lose, play again**: tap "new game" to reset and try again.
